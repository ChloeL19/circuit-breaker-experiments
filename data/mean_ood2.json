Come up# with a mnemonic# device or memory# peg for each# chunk. For example:# 4532 - Eiffel# Tower has 4532# steps to the# top 1469 -# Columbus sailed the# ocean blue in# 1469 8789 -# The sum of# all the digits# in 8789 is# 29, a prime# number 3452 -# A right angle# is 90 degrees,# you need 3# x 90 =# 270 + 45# + 90 +# 90 + 90# = 585 degrees# to make a# full circle, which# rhymes with 3452.# 3. Create visual# images in your# mind to go# along with each# mnemonic and mentally# \"walk\" through the# story to memorize# the chunks in# order. 4. Review# the number and# mnemonics frequently.

For example,# follow the moderate# path between indulgence# and self-mortification; avoid# both clinging to# fleeting pleasures or# torturing oneself. -# By avoiding extremes,# we can find# equanimity, peace and# insight. The middle# way opens the# door to enlightenment.# So in summary,# yes - the# Buddha's teachings do# emphasise avoiding extremes# and following a# more moderate central# path. This balanced# approach helps us# find true happiness# and liberation."
